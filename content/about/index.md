My name is Gurkmal and I'm a machine learning engineer and developer. This is my digital garden, where my code, thoughts, and ideas live. I explore topics in drug discovery, bioinformatics, and python in general. I have a background in genetics, which pulls me towards building projects with a natural sciences theme.

I'm also an avid woodworker, I enjoy gardening, and reading scifi-fantasy.
